This project contains a Dijkstra's Algorithm (JAVA), which is used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This specific implementation considers a graph with 12 vertices, representing a network where nodes are connected with various edge weights. The goal is to fiind the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices
